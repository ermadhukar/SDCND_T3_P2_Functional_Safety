UDACITY SDCND Term3 Project2: Functional Safety Project 

## Overview

This project deals with partial Functional Safety analysis of Lane Assistance System based on ISO 26262 standard. 
ISO 26262 deals with the Functional Safety of the Electrical and Electronics components of a system.

Lane Assistance system, which is a functionality of Self Driving Car has two major functions: 

Lane departure warning (LDW): Provide vibration in the steering when the system detects vehicle moving away from lane.

Lane keeping assistance (LKA): Provide assisting Torue to steer the vehicle back to the center of the driving lane.

Document templates, architectural diagrams and guidance on how to approach the project are provided here.

Functional Safety analysis of present system consists of following documents:

   1. Safety Plan
   2. Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
   3. Functional Safety Concept
   4. Technical Safety Concept
   5. Software Requirements

Present analysis has been done for the partial system and will require additional analysis to cover entire system.
