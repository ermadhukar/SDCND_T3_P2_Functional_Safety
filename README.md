## Overview

This project deals with partial Functional Safety analysis of Lane Assistance System based on ISO 26262 standard. 
ISO 26262 deals with the Functional Safety of the Electrical and Electronics components of a sytem.

Lane Assistance system, which is a functionality of Self Driving Car has two major functions:

    Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
    Functional Safety Concept
    Technical Safety Concept
    Software Requirements

Present analysis has been done for the partial system and will require additional analysis to cover entire system.
